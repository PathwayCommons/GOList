# Programming Task
#### Web applications developer

## About this Task

We are asking you to implement a simple web application to help us better appreciate your programming and problem-solving skills. The task is intended to be straightforward and should not occupy more than a couple of hours of your time. We appreciate elegance and simplicity.

## Step I: Implement
You will implement a ‘Grocery List’ application that users will interact with through the web browser. It should collect brief, text-based descriptions of grocery items and display them to the user. The implementation of the Grocery List is completely up to you! To help you along we have included the functional requirements, technical details, and some restrictions.

### Functional Requirements
The Grocery List application should:
  - Accept text submissions of individual grocery items
  - Keep track of user-submitted items
  - Display the list of items
  - Permit deletion of previously submitted items
  - Permit editing of previously submitted items

### Usability Requirements
The Grocery List interface should:
  - Be intuitive (i.e. not require excessive documentation to use)
  - Be easy to learn
  - Provide feedback when appropriate

### Technical Details
We have supplied you with a directory named ‘Grocery_List’ containing a skeleton application. Do not alter the name of the parent directory. Inside this directory you will find:

  - `index.html` - entrypoint for your Grocery List application
  - `README.md` - for you to document your submission (see Step 2 below)
  - [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) - specifying dependencies
  - [`gulpfile.js`](http://gulpjs.com/) - specifying tasks

The skeleton application is merely a suggestion to get you started. You are free to edit the contents and add/remove any ancillary directories/files within the Grocery_List parent directory. We do, however, require that your application be viewable upon opening a supplied  `index.html` file locally in a web browser. This alone should be sufficient to view your Grocery List application. The HTML output will be viewed on a desktop in Chrome (v51.0.2074).

### Restrictions
To reduce the complexity of submissions, we suggest you adhere to a few restrictions:
- Do not alter the name of the parent Grocery_List directory
- Do not implement or include dependencies on a web server
- Do not implement or include dependencies on database persistence
- Avoid any user-specific features (e.g. sign up, login, authentication, authorization)


## Step 2: Document
We have supplied a markdown file (`README.md`) for the purposes of documenting your submission. Edit the contents of this file including the ‘Contact’ details. The ‘Description’ should contain a brief (< 500 words) overview of major features and design decisions. If necessary, use the ‘Setup’ section for step-by-step instructions on how to get your application to run in a browser (e.g. loading npm or bower dependencies).

## Step 3: Submit
Zip the Grocery_List directory containing your code submission and associated documentation into a single file. At a bare minimum, your submission must contain the following two files:
1. `index.html`
2. `README.md`

Email your submission to ccbr.software.jobs@gmail.com. We will confirm your submission upon receipt via email.
